  <h1>Strawberries</h1>

  <p>In the summer of my twentieth year, I lived in a room shaped like a violin case.</p>

  <p>It was in a half abandoned boarding house in the outskirts of a town with no trains, only bus timetables that seemed to change out of spite. My room had one window which opened not to the sky, but to the back of another building's throat...</p>

  <p>She lived in the room across from mine. The hallway was narrow, as though the building feared we might ever walk past each other unscathed.</p>

  <p>Her name was Livia.</p>

  <p>She said it as though she’d stolen it.<br>
  I said my name as though I’d forgotten it.</p>

  <p>We met over spilled tea. That is not a metaphor. I was balancing a cup on a stack of books while unlocking my door when she opened hers abruptly and startled the whole stack into surrender...</p>

  <p>Eventually, the violin case creaked open. The landlord died and the house was sold. Livia packed nothing. I packed everything she forgot.</p>

  <p>She left without knocking.</p>

  <p>I stayed another week in the empty room, with her scent fading from the walls like breath on a mirror. Then I too left...</p>

  <p>Now, when people say “Tell me about your first love,” I say:<br>
  “She lived across the hall from me.<br>
  She wore her hunger like perfume.<br>
  And when I smiled too brightly, she flinched.<br>
  We were twin ghosts pretending to be candles.”</p>

  <p>And then I turn the page.</p>

  <p>And if they don’t understand,<br>
  I tell them it was all just a story I once read in a very sad, very beautiful book.</p>
