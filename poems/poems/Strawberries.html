# Strawberries 

In the summer of my twentieth year, I lived in a room shaped like a violin case.

It was in a half abandoned boarding house in the outskirts of a town with no trains, only bus timetables that seemed to change out of spite. My room had one window which opened not to the sky, but to the back of another building's throat. It pointed directly towards a soot streaked chimney that coughed softly in the wind like an old woman in church.

She lived in the room across from mine. The hallway was narrow, as though the building feared we might ever walk past each other unscathed.

Her name was Livia.

She said it as though she’d stolen it.
I said my name as though I’d forgotten it.

We met over spilled tea. That is not a metaphor. I was balancing a cup on a stack of books while unlocking my door when she opened hers abruptly and startled the whole stack into surrender. She knelt before the mess, dabbing at the carpet with the sleeve of her sweater, which she continued to wear even in July, and I saw the inside of her wrist white as an unplayed key.

“I can fix it” she said. She always said that.

Soon, we became two people sharing one orbit. I brought her strawberries in cracked porcelain bowls. She tied my shoelaces when my hands trembled too much. We invented rituals: a knock knock language, a ledger of jokes that only worked if you were tired enough, and a shared toothbrush that neither of us ever officially agreed to share.

When I left the house, she sighed. When she cried, I apologized. When she laughed, I counted it. And when she disappeared for hours, returning with the sweet, sick scent of soap and shame, I looked away. That was the rule: one of us always looked away.

Our souls had grown, it seemed, like vines in a bottle. We each pressed closer to the glass, trying to bloom for the other, but there was no room for petals. Only knots.

Sometimes, she would say: “You’re the only person who really sees me.”
And I would say: “If I let go of you, I fall.”
And neither of us knew whether that meant love or drowning.

Eventually, the violin case creaked open. The landlord died (with elegant timing) and the house was sold. Livia packed nothing. I packed everything she forgot.

She left without knocking.

I stayed another week in the empty room, with her scent fading from the walls like breath on a mirror. Then I too left. But I never quite arrived anywhere after that.

Now, when people say “Tell me about your first love,” I say:
“She lived across the hall from me.
She wore her hunger like perfume.
And when I smiled too brightly, she flinched.
We were twin ghosts pretending to be candles.”

And if they don’t understand,
I tell them it was all just a story I once read in a very sad, very beautiful book.

And then I turn the page.
